				<p>My name is Sean Schlichte. I am
				a student of computer programming, and choose to be
				so with the hope of one day designing video games.
				While I have tempered this dream, my computer coding
				skills have only sharpened over the years, and I am
				now aiming for web design and database coding in my 
				future career. I look forward to the coming semester,
				and plan to learn and experience as much as I can.

				I've been learning how to code HTML, Python, Java 
				and such for the last seven years, starting in high
				school. I've never worked with code though: all of	
				my work has been blue collar, union work for cities
				and a few private corporations.

				<div class="hidden-xs hidden-sm hidden-md col-lg-2" id="backgroundOne">
				For five years I have worked through higher 
				education, attending both Highline College and
				Renton Technical College, and gaining an associates
				and will be achieveing a bachelor's degree in 
				computer science in the Summer of 2019. I'm familiar
				with Java, C, Python and the HTML core languages of
				HTML, CSS, and Javascript. I'm comfortable with
				learning new languages as well, and able to adapt
				to the market as need be.
				</div>

				<div class="hidden-xs hidden-sm hidden-md col-lg-2" id="backgroundTwo">
				My work has been rather light in code... or
				rather, I've never coded commercially. All of
				my work has been geared into blue collar: dock
				worker, HVAC Aide, Backroom Stocker for Sears.
				My best work has been for the cities of Bellevue
				(where I worked with their road crew) and with
				Federal Way, working to maintain their parks.
				I do have familiar and associate contacts within
				the computer industry though, so there is that.
